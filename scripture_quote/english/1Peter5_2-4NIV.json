{"quote":"Be shepherds of God’s flock that is under your care, watching over them—not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.","verse":"1 Peter 5:2-4 NIV","language":"English","fileName":"1Peter5_2-4NIV","fileType":"scripture_quote","fileDescription":"1 Peter 5:2-4 NIV","category":"english","tags":["shepherd"]}
