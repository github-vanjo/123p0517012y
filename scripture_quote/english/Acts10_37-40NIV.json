{"quote":"You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. “We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.","verse":"Acts 10:37-40 NIV","language":"English","fileName":"Acts10_37-40NIV","fileType":"scripture_quote","fileDescription":"Acts 10:37-40 NIV","category":"english","tags":["anointed","holy spirit","raised","god was with him"]}
