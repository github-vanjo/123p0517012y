{"quote":"Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.","verse":"1 John 4:8-10 NIV","language":"English","fileName":"1John4_8-10 NIV","fileType":"scripture_quote","fileDescription":"1 John 4:8-10 NIV","category":"english","tags":["love","son","sent"]}
