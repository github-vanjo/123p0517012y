{"quote":"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.","verse":"1 John 4:1-3 NIV","language":"English","fileName":"1John4_1-3NIV","fileType":"scripture_quote","fileDescription":"1 John 4:1-3 NIV","category":"english","tags":["anti-christ"]}
