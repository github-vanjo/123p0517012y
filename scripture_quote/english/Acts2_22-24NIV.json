{"quote":"“Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.","verse":"Acts 2:22-24 NIV","language":"English","fileName":"Acts2_22-24NIV","fileType":"scripture_quote","fileDescription":"Acts 2:22-24 NIV","category":"english","tags":["man","sent","raised"]}
