{"quote":"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinnedâ€” Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.","verse":"Romans 5:12,18-19 NIV","language":"English","fileName":"Romans5_12,18-19NIV","fileType":"scripture_quote","fileDescription":"Romans 5:12,18-19 NIV","category":"english","tags":["man","sin","adam","christ"]}
