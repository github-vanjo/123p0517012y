{"quote":"Peter and the other apostles replied: “We must obey God rather than human beings! The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead—whom you killed by hanging him on a cross. God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might bring Israel to repentance and forgive their sins. We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”","verse":"Acts 5:29-32 NIV","language":"English","fileName":"Acts5_29-32NIV","fileType":"scripture_quote","fileDescription":"Acts 5:29-32 NIV","category":"english","tags":["only one god","one god","one true god","raised","exalted","right hand of god","prince","savior","witness","holy spirit"]}
